# MouseIconDemo for SSD1306
Demo of changing images using the mouse.   
I used [this](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/peripherals/usb/host/hid) as a reference.   

The image changes according to mouse clicks.

I borrowed the BIT MAP data from here.

# Hardware requirements

- ESP32S2/S3   
 These have USB-HOST functionality.

- USB Connector   
 I used this:   
 ![usb-conector-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05f3f79d-00d1-4d65-ad46-67d2e987bc88)

- USB mouse   
 2-button or 3-button usb mouse.   

# USB wiring   
To stabilize the power supply, I placed a 100uF electrolytic capacitor between 5V and GND.   
```
ESP32-S2/S3 BOARD           USB CONNECTOR
                            +--+
    [  5V   ]  +--------->  | || VCC
    [GPIO 19]  |--------->  | || D-
    [GPIO 20]  |--------->  | || D+
    [  GND  ]  |--------+>  | || GND
               |        |   +--+
               +---||---+
                  100uF
```

# USB hot socket
There are times when it works correctly and times when it doesn't.   
It works more stably if you connect before starting the firmware.   
When it works correctly, a log like this will be displayed.   
```
I (1166) usb_hid: hid_host_device_callback
I (1166) usb_hid: HID Device, protocol 'MOUSE' CONNECTED
```

# Using USB-HUB
I tried it, but it doesn't work properly via USB-HUB.

# Transfer failed error
For some reason, the following error may occur in rare cases.   
This error occurs within [this](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/usb_host_hid) component.   
It is unclear whether it is a component bug or an effect of electrical noise.   
Some kind of stabilization circuitry may be required.   
It may come back to life if you unplugging the mouse and plugging it again.   
I would like to hear the opinion of someone who is familiar with USB electrical circuits.   
```
E (12287696) hid-host: Transfer failed, status 1
E (12287696) usb_hid: HID Device, protocol 'MOUSE' TRANSFER_ERROR
E (15953516) USBH: Device 1 gone
```

# Keyboard with mouse function
I have a keyboard with mouse functionality, but the keyboard with mouse functionality does not work as a mouse.   
See [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/12667).
